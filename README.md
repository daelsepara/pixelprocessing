R programs from Advanced Signal and Image Processing Class

#### process_freeman

Determine the Freeman vector codes (as an image or a vector), Fourier descriptors, shape vertices and boundary

#### freeman_gradient

Compute for the gradient and running sums from a Freeman vector

#### scaleimage

Magnify a shape n times (n is a positive integer)

#### edge_detect

Edge detection using Sobel, Sobel-Feldman, Prewitt operators

#### rotate_shape

Rotate shape about an origin

#### invariant_moments

Computing the invariant and normalized central moments of an image based on
the work of Hu (1962)

#### complex_moments

Compute for the complex rotation invariant moments based on the work of Flusser, Suk, Zitova

#### hu_moments

Alternative computation of Hu invariant moments

#### invariant_moments_shape

Compute for  the invariant and normalized central moments of a shape

#### lbp

Function to compute the LBP of an image at each pixel, excluding the ones at the boundaries
